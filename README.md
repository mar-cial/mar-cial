# César for the homies

Hey there, my name is César Marcial from Mexicali, Baja California, México. I'm currently working mainly as a front-end developer 
with fullstack activities. 

## Technologies I use in almost every project

- React first and foremost
- Typescript 
- Next.js whenever I can
- TailwindCSS
- Jest

## I believe in:

- Developing great looking software (both inside and out)
- Blockchain technologies 
- CSS in JS. Sue me.

## Things I'm learning

I'm currently learning the Solidity, Hardhat and OpenZeppelin stack.
Once I feel decent at those, I'll learn Vue and GraphQL.
